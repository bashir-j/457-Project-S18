      "description": "The Winged Victory of Samothrace, also called the Nike of Samothrace, is a marble Hellenistic sculpture of Nike (the Greek goddess of victory), that was created about the 2nd century BC. Since 1884, it has been prominently displayed at the Louvre and is one of the most celebrated sculptures in the world. H.W. Janson described it as 'the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture', and it is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies."
